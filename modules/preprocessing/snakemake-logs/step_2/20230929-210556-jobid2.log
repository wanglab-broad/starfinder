MissingOutputException in rule step_2 in file /stanley/WangLab/jiahao/Github/starfinder/modules/preprocessing/Snakefile, line 89:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
